Self-Organising Maps - City Climates Example
--------------------------------------------

* the example task is to cluster cities having a similar monthly mean temperature climatology
* `city_climatologies.nc` dataset was compiled from ECMWF ERA5-Land monthly averaged data covering years 2000-2021 - See Muñoz Sabater, J., 2019
* city locations provided by [https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities](https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities)
* output a plot of cities on the output SOM

## running the example

* install `somrun` and `somplot` using the instructions in the [main README](../../README.md)
* change to the directory containing this file: `cd examples/city_climates`
* run the script `run_example.sh` to fit-transform the input data in `city_climatolgies.nc` using 2M-temperature (t2m)
* the following file should be generated by `somrun`, from reading `city_climatologies.nc`
  * `city_som_hex.nc` - input data augmented with SOM assignments and SOM cell coordinates
* the following file should be generated by `somplot`, from reading `city_som_hex.nc`
  * `city_som_hex_t2m.svg` - plot of city placements on the SOM grid, coloured by mean annual temperature
  * `city_som_hex_t2m.csv` - CSV file containing SOM assignments and t2m
